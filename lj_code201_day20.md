# LJ Code 201 - Day 20
7/10

I spent the weekend mostly relaxing, since there's some kind of glitch in the email system and I still havne't received my invite to the 301 Canvas site.

Ran through the jQuery stuff on codeacademy. It's slightly obnoxious to see things that we worked on like crazy reduced to a couple of lines in jQuery, but I completely understand the logic of learning vanilla js first. I didn't have any problems at all following along with what was going on in the tutorials, so that was nice. 

I'm sure I'll be in over my head soon enough. :)
