## Day 4 - 6/16

Yesterday I felt like I was clinging madly to my Python knowledge, because I was very frustrated with the process of writing loops in js. Today was much better--I felt like I have a much better handle on things, although I'm sure that a lot of that was the pair/group programming work for the lab in the afternoon.  I was working with Derek and David, and we really blazed through the work.  I was even able to get the stretch goals done after we turned in the assignment, which was awesome.

CSS layout stuff continues to be frustrating. I really feel kind of directionless as far as knowing where to start with design decisions. I'm hoping that this will change once we starting talking more about design. 

I'm still trying to get a handle on how relative and absolute positioning relate. (Although I haven't yet watched the stuff that Brian put in the Slack channel yet, and hopefully that will help.) 

I felt yesterday like my solution to the lab for day three was unreasonably clunky and there should have been some way to simplify it--but the code review solution this morning was almost exactly like mine.

Things I need to remember:
* get used to console logging so that debugging is easier.
* when testing, test strings, negative numbers, zero, float vs int, numbers where strings are expected and vice versa.
