# LJ Code 201 - Day 15
7/01

We started on our projects today. I really felt like we all have vastly different ideas about how much to get done over the holiday weekend, and I really wasn't sure how to reconcile those things. It was very frustrating. 

Nadia gave us some very good tips on process and how to organize:

1. Use Waffle, and put an 'M' in front of any issue that's related to MVP.
2. No more than 5 PR open at a time, then do a merge party.
3. Branches should be named after the issue number, so we can tell who is working on what.
4. Merge Party at the start (after standup meeting) and end of every day.

We're going to use Google Maps in the project, and so I need to look through the API this weekend.

I know that I'm going to struggle with communication, and I have to resist the urge to try to do everything all at once. I'm concerned that I still feel like I don't have a handle on how much planning is 'enough'.
