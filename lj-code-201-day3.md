#LJ Code 201 - Day 3
6/15

Today's lab was very frustrating, mostly because I was *so close* to figuring out what was wrong, and knew it, and couldn't figure out what was wrong. Fortunately, I got it to work eventually, with help. I sitll feel like my code for question 7 is much more complicated than it needs to be, but I can't figure out how to simplify it.
